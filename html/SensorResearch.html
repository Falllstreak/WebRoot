                <b>Usage:</b>
                <br><br>
                This list of sources was helpful in me gathering ideas on how to alter my application project idea. At first I wanted to build a social app for humans to keep track and share
                information about their dogs. It had an emphasis on showing dog park information and hotspots for activity to the user. After looking into the sensors I've thought of a more
                personal project that could be a bit more useful for an individual.
                <br><br>
                The sources I provide go over a variety of sensors in iPhones, Android phones, and Google Fit. The one that stood out to me is the gyroscope features many phones have. This is one
                that I want to utilize in my application to create a posture-checker app. You would wear the device (phone or other device) and it can inform the user is their posture is incorrect through
                a chime or vibration. It will keep track of that and provide a score of some sort. Through my research I found that many phones and mobile devices have this gyroscopic feature. I'm 
                excited to implement and use it!
